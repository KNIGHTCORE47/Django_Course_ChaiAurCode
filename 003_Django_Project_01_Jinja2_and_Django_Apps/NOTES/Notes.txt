*** Jinja2 And django inner apps ***


NOTE - Jinja2 is a inbuilt template injecting method of django framework

Jinja2 denotes with - {% %}

{% block title %}
    any_value
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    
{% endblock %}


in main_project inside template/html/index.html

NOTE - 
    Here we have modified index.html file according to layout.html to fit in.

{% extends "layout.html" %}  = it means that we are extending layout.html file to index.html

{% block title %}
    Home
{% endblock %}  = it means that we are adding title to index.html by using dynamic title block provided by Jinja2


{% block content %} {% endblock %} = it means that we are adding content of index.html and export it to layout.html where layout.html is the parent wrapper of all other html files.




**NOTE - django alwase creates/invokes the inner apps, but we have to manually wiring the apps with the main django project. The process is -

Step01 - django inner apps:
    commands:
        python manage.py startapp my_app

Step02 -

main_project ---> settings.py ---> INSTALLED_APPS = ['my_app']


main_project ---> settings.py ---> TEMPLATES = [{'DIRS': 'templates'}]

main_project ---> urls.py [ 
    from django.urls import path, include

    path('api/v1/', include('my_app'))
]

main_project/my_app ---> urls.py
                    ---> viwes.py
